My Interactive Resume

Hello! Welcome to the repository for my interactive online resume. I built this project to showcase my skills and experience in a dynamic and engaging way, going beyond a traditional static document. I believe it offers a more comprehensive and interactive experience for anyone interested in learning about my background in Computer Science.
About This Project

I designed this resume to be a living document that highlights my passion for technology and problem-solving. It's not just a list of qualifications; it's an interactive experience where you can explore my education, skills, and projects, and even chat with an AI assistant that I've trained on my own resume data!
Key Features

    Interactive Sections: I've implemented collapsible sections for my Summary, Education, Skills, and Projects, making it easy to navigate and focus on what interests you most.

    Dynamic Animations: You'll notice subtle animations throughout, like the typewriter effect on my summary, and animated progress bars for my degree completion and GPA in the Education section. I even added a toggle to turn off the RGB text if you prefer a simpler look!

    Live Demos: I've included mini-demos for some of my projects, like a simple Grocery Stock Manager and an AI-powered Fun Fact Generator, so you can see my work in action.

    Availability Calendar: I've created a visual calendar to show my standard availability, which even has a fun hover effect.

    AI Chatbot: This is one of my favorite features! I integrated a custom chatbot that can answer questions about my resume, personal insights, hobbies, and family life. It's powered by the Gemini API and acts as my digital assistant.

    Copy-to-Clipboard Functionality: For convenience, I've added buttons next to my contact information so you can easily copy my email, phone number, or GitHub URL.

Technologies I Used

I built this interactive resume using a modern web development stack:

    HTML5: For the structure and content of the page.

    CSS3: For all the styling, animations, and responsive design. I leveraged custom CSS variables to maintain a consistent theme.

    JavaScript (ES6+): For all the interactive elements, animations, data handling, and API integrations.

    Tailwind CSS: I used this utility-first CSS framework to rapidly style the components and ensure responsiveness across different devices. It really helps streamline the styling process.

    Font Awesome: For all the professional and thematic icons used throughout the resume.

    Gemini API: I integrated this API to power the Fun Fact Generator demo and my interactive chatbot, demonstrating my ability to work with advanced AI models.
